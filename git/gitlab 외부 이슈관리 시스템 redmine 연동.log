From Gitlab, #1 reference Gitlab issue No.1

To reference a Redmine issue, you must use prefixed issue number instead (Redmine project Identifier + Redmine issue number) <PROJECT>-<ID> where <PROJECT> starts with a capital letter which is then followed by capital letters, numbers or underscores, and <ID> is a number (example API_32-143 ).

For referencing and fixing issues in commit messages, you should look at Redmine Administration->Settings->Repository->Referencing keywords.
